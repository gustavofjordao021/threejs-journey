Instantiate a single Object (mesh) or a Group and, when you want to create a new object, you can add it to the Group you just created using the add(...) method rather than adding it directly to the scene.

// Moves object in an x, y, and z axis, which are the 3 necessary axes to position something in a 3D space.

When you change the x, y, and z properties of a Euler, you can imagine putting a stick through your object's center in the axis's direction and then rotating that object on that stick. The value of these axes is expressed in radians. In native JavaScript, you can end up with an approximation of Ï€ using Math.PI.
